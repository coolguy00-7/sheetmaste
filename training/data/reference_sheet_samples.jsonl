{"event":"Chemistry Lab","division":"C","source":"manual_sample","analysis":"Covered topics: stoichiometry, limiting reagent, molarity, acid-base titration calculations, significant figures, uncertainty propagation. Skills practiced: balancing equations, unit conversion, dilution calculations, endpoint identification from indicators, graph reading.

Missing areas: electrochemistry, thermochemistry, kinetics.","reference_sheet":"CHEM LAB QUICK MAP\nStoich: mol ratios from balanced eqn; always convert mass->mol first.\nMolarity M=n/V(L). Dilution: M1V1=M2V2.\nLimiting reagent: calc product from each reactant; lowest wins.\n%yield=(actual/theoretical)*100.\nSig figs: mult/div -> fewest SF, add/sub -> fewest decimal places.\nUncertainty (independent): sqrt(sum of squares).\nTitration: at equivalence n(acid)=n(base) adjusted by coefficients.\nStrong acid/base pH: pH=-log[H+], pOH=-log[OH-], pH+pOH=14.\nWeak acid shortcut if x<<C: [H+]~sqrt(Ka*C).\nTRAPS: forgetting liters, using unbalanced eqn, rounding too early, mixing endpoint vs equivalence.\nFAST PATTERN: annotate given units, write target unit, chain factors left->right.\nMINI EX: 25.0 mL HCl neutralized by 30.0 mL 0.100 M NaOH (1:1) => n NaOH=0.00300 mol => M HCl=0.00300/0.0250=0.120 M.\nCHECKLIST: units, SF, reasonableness, sign/direction, final boxed answer."}
